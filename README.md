## Project Description

This tool can be used to generate a CSS file and HTML of cards for organizing an engineering team's employee information. The cards are created dynamically using user input gathered from inquirer. Within the terminal the user is prompted to add either a manager, an engineer, or an intern. After selecting an employee, a series of appropriate questions are asked for the user to input information. These questions will ask a few special questions depending upon the employee's role. Input questions include: Role, name, email, github account, office room number, and ID number. The email links will open to the user's email software with the email in the address. Github account names can be clicked to open the account in a new tab.
